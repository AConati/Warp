**Brief Description:**                  
Warp is an arcade style survival video game where you need to collect stones. The player's score will be higher depending on how many stones they collect. The game gets progressively more difficult as time progresses and the player survives. A key feature of the game is the ability to throw an object and teleport to that object in order to dodge other projectiles.
